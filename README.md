# Olsalazine Project

Computational studies of amine-appended Mg$`_2`$(olz) and Mg$`_2`$(dobpdc) MOFs, promising materials for cooperative CO$`_2`$ adsorption. This work aims at resolving the system's atomic structure in the presence of CO$`_2`$ and H$`_2`$O from first-principles relaxations and NMR calculations as well as neural network potential driven molecular dynamics and conformer search. Here you will find a sample of scripts and jupyter notebooks to implement workflow tasks.
